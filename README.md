# area_calculator

## 📌 Project description: Geometric Area Calculator

### 📝 Summary
This project is an interactive console application in Python for calculating the area of various geometric shapes. The user chooses a figure from among triangles, rectangles, squares and circles, enters the required dimensions and obtains the corresponding area.

### 🎯 Objectifs
  - Offer a simple, intuitive tool for calculating areas.

  - Guarantee a smooth user experience by managing input errors.

  - Ensure program robustness by preventing invalid values (e.g. negative numbers, text instead of digits).
   
### 🔹 Features

  ✅ Interactive menu with available shapes.
  
  ✅ Support for user input with error validation.

  ✅ Calculating areas using mathematical formulas :

  - Triangle: $(base × height) / $2

  - Rectangle: $length × width$.

  - Square: $side²$

  - Circle: $π × radius²$
    
✅ Display results with 2-decimal formatting.

✅ Option to exit the application cleanly by selecting the dedicated option.

### ⚙️ Technologies used
- Python 3

- Math library (for π in calculating circle area)

### 🚀 Possible improvements
🔹 Add other geometric shapes (trapezoid, rhombus, etc.).

🔹 Allow the user to choose the unit of measurement (cm², m², etc.).

🔹 Create a graphical user interface (GUI) with Tkinter or PyQt.

🔹 Generate a calculation report as a text file.

💡 An ideal project for learning user input management and control structures in Python! 🐍🚀
